            Hello, I'm Cole Blunt, glad you are here,<br><br>
            Every challenge is an opportunity, and I thrive on turning ideas into unique user experiences. 
            As a recent graduate from Grand Valley State University with a bachelor's degree in computer science, 
            I have honed my programming skills in writing, debugging code, and meticulous documentation. 
            I am adept at utilizing Version Control to ensure the delivery of high-quality apps and games.<br><br>
            But my passion extends beyond programming. I love immersing myself in the captivating world of computer graphics.
            In my spare time, I've dived into learning three.js and Blender for 3D modeling.
            The sheer creativity and wonder of computer graphics never cease to amaze me.
            I've also taken the initiative to learn CSS, allowing me to create a captivating and fun portfolio website.<br><br>
            Beyond the digital realm, I find joy in outdoor activities. During summer, you'll often find me on the golf course or playing disc golf.
            These activities not only provide endless fun with friends but also offer opportunities to meet new people. In the winter, I embrace the slopes as a passionate snowboarder.
            It's a sport that has taught me the importance of perseverance and getting back up after every fall—a lesson I apply to all aspects of my life.<br><br>
            I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and would love to collaborate on projects that challenge conventions and push boundaries.
            Let's create something extraordinary together.
